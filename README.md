# Encryption and Decryption

## What is Encryption?
Encryption is the process of converting human-readable plaintext to incomprehensible text, also known as ciphertext.

## How does encryption work?
Encryption is a mathematical process that alters data using an encryption algorithm and a key.
For example, if Alice sends the message "Hello" to Bob, but she replaces each letter in her message with the letter that comes two places later in the alphabet. Instead of "Hello," her message now reads "Jgnnq." Fortunately, Bob knows that the key is "2" and can decrypt her message back to "Hello."

## What is a key?
A key is a string of characters used within an encryption algorithm for altering data so that it appears random.

## Types of Encryption?
There are two main types: asymmetric encryption and symmetric encryption. <br /> 
In asymmetric encryption, there are two keys: one private key for decryption and one public key for encryption. 
In symmetric encryption, there is one key for both encryption and decryption

## What is an encryption algorithm?
An encryption algorithm is the method used to transform data into ciphertext. An algorithm will use the encryption key in order to alter the data in a predictable way, so that even though the encrypted data will appear random, it can be turned back into plaintext by using the decryption key. <br /> 

Common encryption algorithms:
* AES
* 3-DES
* RSA
