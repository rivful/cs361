# Encryption and Decryption

## What is Encryption?
Encryption is the process of converting human-readable plaintext to incomprehensible text, also known as ciphertext.

## How does encryption work?
Encryption is a mathematical process that alters data using an encryption algorithm and a key.
For example, if Alice sends the message "Hello" to Bob, but she replaces each letter in her message with the letter that comes two places later in the alphabet. Instead of "Hello," her message now reads "Jgnnq." Fortunately, Bob knows that the key is "2" and can decrypt her message back to "Hello."
